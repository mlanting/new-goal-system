NGS Testing Readme
==================

In order to run these tests, you need Tcl support, which you can get with jsoar or by running the tcltosoar.tcl script.

Each of the .soar files in this directory is a stand-alone test agent.  

In order to run the test, set the working directory to this directory and load the agent in a debugger.
