The **New Goal System** (NGS version 3) is a Soar library to support faster development of Soar agents by allowing programming at a higher level of abstraction than that allowed by using Soar alone. NGS uses Tcl macros and added Soar productions to help implement these concepts within a Soar agent. Through these macros, NGS incorporates elements of encapsulation to hide many of the low-level Soar details of object creation, and provides interfaces for matching to standard object structures such as goals and operators.

## Benefits of NGS include ##

  * Forest of Goals: Ability to have multiple active goals at once
  * Actions from different active goals are interleaved by default
  * Tcl macros provide an API to make writing NGS code easy
  * Can be used with both JSoar and CSoar
